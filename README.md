<h2>Code Challege</h2>

I opted to do the CheckWriter Challenge.

Originally I used the NumberFormatter class, which is what I would do in a real world scenario, but then I realized that made this too easy compared to the other challenges.    So I added my own formatter function that can deal with numbers up to 999,999.999,999.99 if the NumberFormat class is not found.

I included a test page - test.php in addition to the Unit Tests.
